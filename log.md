# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed a coding challenge today

**Thoughts**: I might end up completing two challenges a day until I get to the poitn where the challeneges are really tough but for now it was easy.

### Day 3: April 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some Katas on Codewars.

**Thoughts** I went through some Katas that are in ruby and the language is so different but more simplistyic at the same time. I am getting used to the syntax

### Day 4: April 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some Katas on Codewars.

**Thoughts** I was returning a string and I accidentally put puts at first but it returned nil. Ruby instead automatically returns the last line of a function so that was not needed.
